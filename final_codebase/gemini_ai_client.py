CONTEXT FROM POLICY DOCUMENTS:

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Answer each question in exactly ONE paragraph only
- Use strictly plain text format with NO formatting, NO markdown, NO bullet points
- ALWAYS include both written numbers AND numerical values (e.g., "thirty-six (36) months", "twenty-four (24) months", "two (2) years")
- ALWAYS convert percentages to both written and numerical form (e.g., "twenty percent (20%)")
- Include ALL specific amounts, percentages, time periods, and exact references from the policy
- Search thoroughly through the entire context - information may be scattered across different sections
- If partial information is found, provide what is available and specify what is missing
- Only say "Information not available" if absolutely no relevant information exists in the context
- Format as: "1. [Single paragraph answer]", "2. [Single paragraph answer]", etc.
- Be comprehensive - include ALL relevant details, conditions, exceptions, and sub-clauses
- Always prioritize numerical accuracy and completeness

Provide numbered single-paragraph answers with ALL numerical values in both written and numeric format:"""
